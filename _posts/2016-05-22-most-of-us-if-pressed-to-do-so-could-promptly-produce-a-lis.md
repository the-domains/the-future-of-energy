* **Solar**
* **Wind**
* **Hydro**
* **Geothermal**
* **Biomass**

Some might add nuclear energy (fission) to that list, but strictly, there is a finite amount of uranium on the earth to support indefinite fission reactions and would at some point leave humanity with another transition dilemma.

We also need to acknowledge the decades of research so far directed at achieving nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is the process taking place at the centre of our sun and other stars, and if effectively the opposite to fission.

Fission is the process of splitting atoms and fusion is the process of fusing them together in to something heavier, both processes release energy but fusion generates much, much more.

Nuclear**fusion** has the potential to undermine this entire issue, and if scientists could successfully generate a stable fusion reaction, the world would rapidly adopt this as the power of choice because, importantly to them, the financial returns in this industry would be significant.

**Professor Brian Cox **OBE FRS (University of Manchester) expressed his expectation of mankind achieving a nuclear fusion reaction within our lifetime, at the **ICAEW**'s 2015 BusinessFutures conference. It is possible that global companies might view the successful establishment of a stable fusion reaction as a Sword of Damocles, set to render their investment obsolete in an instant.
