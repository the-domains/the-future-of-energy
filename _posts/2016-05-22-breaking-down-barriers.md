**The biggest barriers to moving away from fossil fuel reliance**

_Developing countries_

China and other developing countries demand on having the same opportunity to grow as the other developed countries have had. This position is perfectly understandable, and any move from fossil fuels would need to be available to them for the same level of investment that would be required using fossil fuels.

_Consumption demand keeps increasing_

The lights must stay on, and so any renewable energy solution would be required to run in parallel with the current one, and would temporarily drive costs to a prohibitive level.
