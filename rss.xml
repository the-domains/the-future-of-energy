            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Nuclear Fusion</h1><p>This has the power to undermine the entire debate.  If humanity can establish a stable fusion reaction, we would soon move over to this.  Or create a black hole in the process as always seems to be the case...</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cdcff3f2-442c-4d85-a665-95212e7b4ea8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The power of a European energy union</h1><p>DUBLIN - One of the top priorities established by European Commission (EC) president Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of his election last summer was the creation of a European energy union. He was right to do so.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/92873a1d18ff6eea11964d177502d4cd/croprotate.ashx?cropheight=335&cropwidth=630&degrees=0&input=http%3A%2F%2Feconomia.icaew.com%2Fopinion%2Ffebruary-2015%2F~%2Fmedia%2FImages%2FArticle%2520images%2Foffshore%2520energy630.ashx&x=0&y=15"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>ICAEW - the future in ten minutes</h1><p>The UK is a single player on the world stage, and cannot alone impact change with its own actions.  For example, between them as of 2011, the USA, Russia, China, Australia and India hold 72% of the worlds coal reserves, which could last for more than 100 years with current consumption3, and no profit making entity will give up such significant reserves lightly or without serious measures to compensate for the sacrifice.  Other holdings of fossil fuel reserves broadly follow this pattern of a few countries holding a significant proportion of the global reserve. Unfortunately, conscience and science will never prevail in this arena, only money will talk.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0a40cb7969d68108e3996bf5ffbcb7274553cbe8.jpg"></article>]]></description>
